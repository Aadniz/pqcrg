# PQCRC

This project demonstrates how one can have quantum-resistant cryptography in a fast paced environment, like a racing game.

This was the Bachelor project of TÃ¸nnes (@Lystrous) and Kristian (@Aadniz) at UiA 2024.

## How it works

The game uses a local bridge to encrypt its traffic over. The bridge communicates with the server bridge that forwards the packets to its local Godot instance. The entire communication looks like shown below.

Kyber-768 is used for the key exchange handshake, and AES-GCM is used for encrypting the packets.

## Setting up

### Development environment

**Dependencies:**

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - Game engine
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - For importing the map
- [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) - For building the bridge
- [CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake) - for compiling PQC

Build the PQC bridge first, then start the Godot Editor

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Aadniz/pqcrg.git
$ cd pqcrg/pqc
$ cargo build  # binds to debug in Godot
$ cargo build --release  # binds to release in Godot
```

Then open Godot and import the Godot folder.

### Running the game pre-compiled

Go to the release section, and download blarg blah blah.
